Output changes:
- `OCH4_{SECTOR}` output variables have been renamed to `ch4_sector_{name}`
- `OCH4_{SECTOR}` variables which previously produced a single time-step are
  now expanded to include a time step for each day in the period
- Output file coordinates have been normalised to ('time', 'vertical', 'y', 'x')
  to follow CF Conventions
