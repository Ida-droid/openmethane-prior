# Overview

Open Methane Prior uses a variety of data sources to estimate emissions from
known methane emission sources. Broadly, these data sources fall into two
categories:
- emission estimates from existing sources
- spatial proxies for methane emissions

## Estimates from existing sources

Gridded methane emission estimates have already been produced for some sectors
in published research or publically available datasets. Where possible, these
estimates are simply regridded onto the Open Methane grid.

## Estimates from spatial proxies

Where no pre-existing gridded estimates are available, the Open Methane Prior
estimates emissions by taking the sectoral total from the
[National Greenhouse Gas Inventory](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-quarterly-updates)
and distributing the emissions based on a spatial dataset that is shown to be a
good proxy for methane emissions in that sector.

For example, light pollution is a good spatial proxy for industrial activity.
Therefore, a map of nighttime light in Australia can be used to distribute
the industrial sectoral emissions from the national inventory spatially. We
must take care to ensure that the sectoral estimate and the spatial proxy
cover the exact same domain, or the spatial proxy must be masked.

The spatialised estimates are then regridded onto the Open Methane grid.

# General data sources

Some data sources are used by multiple sectors of the prior.

## Australian UNFCCC Inventory

Australia reports GHG emissions broken down by gas and by sector under its
UNFCCC obligations. The data is available via the
[National Greenhouse Accounts](https://greenhouseaccounts.climatechange.gov.au/)
web tool, and also via a "Bulk data API".

For the prior we're only interested in CH4 emissions, so the full UNFCCC sector
dataset was fetched and filtered with jq:

```shell
curl -s https://greenhouseaccounts.climatechange.gov.au/OData/AR5_ParisInventory_AUSTRALIA \
  | jq --raw-output '
    (["InventoryYear_ID", "UNFCCC_Level_1", "UNFCCC_Level_2", "UNFCCC_Level_3", "UNFCCC_Level_4", "UNFCCC_Level_5", "Gg"] | @csv),
    (
      .value[]
      | select(.Gas_Level_0 == "CH4")
      | [.InventoryYear_ID, .UNFCCC_Level_1, .UNFCCC_Level_2, .UNFCCC_Level_3, .UNFCCC_Level_4, .UNFCCC_Level_5, .Gg]
      | @csv
    )
  ' \
  > AR5_ParisInventory_AUSTRALIA_CH4.csv
```

This series of commands:
- fetches the full dataset
- constructs a CSV header row
- filters the dataset to only items with `"Gas_Level_0": "CH4"`
- selects the attributes of interest
- outputs in CSV format

This filtered dataset is available in our public data store:
https://openmethane.s3.amazonaws.com/prior/inputs/AR5_ParisInventory_AUSTRALIA_CH4.csv

## UNFCCC CRT categories 

To allocate inventory emissions to prior sectors, we utilise the
`unfccc_categories` in each sector, which contain UNFCCC CRT category codes,
like "5" (Waste), "3.B" (Agriculture - Enteric Fermentation). However, the
[Australian UNFCCC Inventory](#Australian_UNFCCC_Inventory) doesn't include
category codes, only full names of the UNFCCC categories (some of which are
not exact from the original definitions).

A mapping from Australia's inventory categories to UNFCCC has been created to
assist this process. The mapping was created manually by fetching all the
category names present in the Australian inventory, and assigning the correct
code to each category.

File can be created initially by finding unique categories in the bulk data:

```shell
curl -s https://greenhouseaccounts.climatechange.gov.au/OData/AR5_ParisInventory_AUSTRALIA \
  | jq --raw-output '
    (["UNFCCC_Code", "UNFCCC_Level_1", "UNFCCC_Level_2", "UNFCCC_Level_3", "UNFCCC_Level_4"] | @csv),
    (
      .value[]
      | select(.Gas_Level_0 == "CH4")
      | ["", .UNFCCC_Level_1, .UNFCCC_Level_2, .UNFCCC_Level_3, .UNFCCC_Level_4]
      | @csv
    )
  ' \
  | uniq \
  > UNFCCC-codes.csv
```

Note: this excludes level 5 categorisation, where codes are sometimes harder to
identify and prior sectors are unlikely to model categories to this level.

This generates a file with empty values for "UNFCCC_Code" which must then be
populated manually.

The completed mapping is available in our public data store:
