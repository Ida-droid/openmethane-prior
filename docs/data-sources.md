# Overview

Open Methane Prior uses a variety of data sources to estimate emissions from
known methane emission sources. Broadly, these data sources fall into two
categories:
- emission estimates from existing sources
- spatial proxies for methane emissions

## Estimates from existing sources

Gridded methane emission estimates have already been produced for some sectors
in published research or publically available datasets. Where possible, these
estimates are simply regridded onto the Open Methane grid.

## Estimates from spatial proxies

Where no pre-existing gridded estimates are available, the Open Methane Prior
estimates emissions by taking the sectoral total from the
[National Greenhouse Gas Inventory](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/climate-change/publications/national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-quarterly-updates)
and distributing the emissions based on a spatial dataset that is shown to be a
good proxy for methane emissions in that sector.

For example, light pollution is a good spatial proxy for industrial activity.
Therefore, a map of nighttime light in Australia can be used to distribute
the industrial sectoral emissions from the national inventory spatially. We
must take care to ensure that the sectoral estimate and the spatial proxy
cover the exact same domain, or the spatial proxy must be masked.

The spatialised estimates are then regridded onto the Open Methane grid.


# Data Sources

## Sector: Livestock

Australian national dataset of CH4 flux estimates from enteric fermentation in livestock

### Sources

Enteric fermentation emissions generated by CSIRO Ag. and Food using livestock
census data and UNFCCC emissions factors. Underlying livestock numbers
taken from: "Navarro, J. Marcos Martinez, R. (2021) Estimating long-term profits, fertiliser and pesticide use
baselines in Australian agricultural regions. User Guide. CSIRO,
Australia." 

- Dataset: [EntericFermentation.nc][4]
- Resolution: 0.01 degree
- Period: 2020, single annual average
- Updates: never

### Considerations

- Spatial distribution might change during the year since farmers are moving their cows around
- Doesn't appear to be available online

### Alternative candidates

- https://publications.csiro.au/publications/publication/PIcsiro:EP2022-1389/
  - Resolution: 0.1 degree
  - Period: 1972 - 2019, annual averages
  - Global
- Electronic ear tags might be a useful database


## Sector: Termites

Global dataset of CH4 flux estimates from termites

### Sources

Termite emissions used in [Saunois et al. 2020](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1561/2020/)
supplied by Simona Castaldi and Sergio Noce.

- Dataset: [termite_emissions_2010-2016.nc][14]
- Resolution: 0.5 degree
- Period: mean of 2010 – 2016
- Updates: never

### Considerations

- No Australian database
- Rough spatial resolution
- Database doesn't appear to be available online
  - Possibly source dataset for
    [Global Methane Budget 2000-2017](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1561/2020/essd-12-1561-2020.html)? 

### Alternative candidates

- https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/datasets/cams-global-emission-inventories?tab=overview
    - Same resolution: 0.5 degree
    - Temporal coverage for termites is stated as 2000, but the
      [documentation](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/sites/default/files/2019-11/26_CAMS81_2017SC1_D81.3.4.1-201808_v1_APPROVED_Ver1.pdf)
      claims termite estimates "representative for the years 2000 - 2017".
    - Includes monthly estimates which feature seasonal variation in Australia
    - Publicly available and referenceable


## Sector: Biomass burning

Global dataset of CH4 flux estimates from biomass burning (wildfires)

### Sources

Daily emissions from the Global Fire Assimilation System (Kaiser et al., 2012, doi:10.5194/bg-9-527-2012)

- Dataset: https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/datasets/cams-global-fire-emissions-gfas?tab=overview
- Resolution: 0.1 degree
- Period: 2003 - present
- Updates: daily, 2 day delay


## Sector: Wetlands

### Sources

Monthly wetland emissions from the diagnostic ensemble used in
[Saunois et al. 2020](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1561/2020/)
and described in Zhang et al. (2023 under review) (could this be https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/2001/2021/?)

- Dataset: [DLEM_totflux_CRU_diagnostic.nc][3]
- Resolution: 0.5 degree
- Period: 2000 - 2020, monthly averages
- Updates: never

### Considerations

- No Australian database
- Rough spatial resolution
- Database/paper doesn't appear to be available online
- There is a new version of Global Methane Budget (2000 - 2024), can we get an updated dataset?

### Alternative candidates

- https://www.icos-cp.eu/GCP-CH4-2024
  - Resolution: 1.0 degrees
  - Period: 2000, monthly averages
