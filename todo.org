* files we need to find
- CAMS/MACC emissions from Copernicus web-site
  - check which emissions are covered so we don't double count
  - These probably supercede EDGAR files
- base files for geogenic emissions 
- GFAS emissions files
- CarbonTracker emission files
  - check double counting between these and MACC/CAMS
- agriculture files from Nasimeh
- Point source emission files
- Distribute other anthropogenic emissions according to nightlights unless there's a better proxy for a category
* define uncertainty for each layer
Usually an expression like $\sigma = \alpha E + \beta$
* Suggested workflow
- define a Grid class
- Make a high-resolution Grid instance, suggest 1km and covering Australia
- Write routines to map each emission onto that rid
- Define a second Grid instance corresponding to our domain
- write regridding routines which probably just aggregate from high-res to chosen
- Write combination script
  - Emissions just add
  - Uncertainties add quadratically as $\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N \sigma_i^2}}$ where $\sigma_i$ is the uncertainty for each sector
