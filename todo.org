* files we need to find
- MACC emissions from Copernicus web-site
  - check which emissions are covered so we don't double count
  - These probably supercede EDGAR files
- base files for geogenic emissions (question for JS)
- GFAS emissions files
- agriculture files from Nasimeh
* Suggested workflow
- define a grid object
- Make a high-resolution instance, suggest 1km and covering Australia
- Write routines to map each emission onto that rid
- Define a second grid object corresponding to our domain
- write regridding routines which probably just aggregate from high-res to chosen
- Write combination script
  - Emissions just add
  - Uncertainties add quadratically as $\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N \sigma_i^2}}$ where $\sigma_i$ is the uncertainty for each sector
